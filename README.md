## How to handle exceptions within Spring Filters and Interceptors 


Filters and Interceptors have quite a different behaviour as they do not act at the same level. 
The project shows within the "config" package how to simply handle an exception and forward an according response. 

- For an Interceptor, we only need an Exception Handler as we have access to the Spring MVC stack

- For a Filter, we need to catch the exception and handle it on the response (response.setStatus/response.getWriter().write(...))


## Why

This example was initially made to answer the following use case :
An existing filter/interceptor does some processing involving an external HTTP call with WebClient, and when the WebClient throws a WebClientResponseException indicating a specific issue & status code (400, 404, ...) it is not properly forwarded and always results in an Internal Error 500.

Handling exceptions with interceptors may look more cumbersome in the code, but 2 of the classes are only involved in configuring the interceptor, the exception handler is easier to setup and it can be reused across the project. 

Filters can be more tricky (not forgetting to call the filterChain, not messing too much with the Servlets, serializing the JSON/.. to return, ..), they can't use a ControllerAdvice/ExceptionHandler as they happen before controllers are resolved, but they do not depend on the MVC stack
